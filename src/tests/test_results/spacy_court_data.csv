In terms of the limitations under the Fifth Amendment, the federal government's powers are more expansive. Many courts believe, as they do under the  Fourteenth Amendment, they should look into whether a defendant has minimum contacts with a particular state. Also, they should see whether a particular law or principle is informative of or equal to the Fifth Amendment.

,,,,,,,,"The powers of the federal government differ from state governments like California and Ohio in terms of their geographical limitations and expansiveness. State governments are bounded by geographical limitations since they can't infringe on the sovereignty of other states. For instance, California can't infringe on Ohio's sovereignty. However, the federal government isn't subject to such limitations. Its powers are more expansive because it has jurisdiction over the entire nation. In contrast, state powers are constrained by 'horizontal federalism', where each state's authority is territorially limited to its boundaries. Additionally, the federal government's power could be viewed within the context of a legitimate government interest. Furthermore, federalism matters for imposed jurisdiction but not for consent jurisdiction. The federal government's jurisdiction isn't limited even by consent. Hence, someone may subject themselves to federal government's powers from which they would otherwise be free, further highlighting the expansiveness of federal powers compared to state governments.",1.0,0.9964036033375033,0.99999999995,1.0,0.6158321199835686
